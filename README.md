# Team Profile Generator (Built with Node)

![license badge](./Assets/license-badge.svg)

## Description

A profile card generator using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the npm package [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). After answering a series of prompts for questions relating to name and email address, an HTML file is created showing your team's information (names, emails, github account, school and office number).

### My motivations

Wanting to store my team's information on a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I can have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

### What I learned

I was able to get more practise in using nodeJS, the inquirer package and in using the command line to write and run JavaScript code.

First time using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) which had a bit of a learning curve to. Something that will require more practise with in the future.
